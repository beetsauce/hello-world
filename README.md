My first repository

In the 1960s, I opened more than 30 karate studios. I taught several celebrities, including Priscilla Presley and actor Steve McQueen. McQueen encouraged his teacher to try acting. In addition to being an instructor, I also was a fierce competitor. I participated in numerous martial arts tournaments, and I won many of the events I competed in.
I earned his first World Middleweight Karate Championship title in 1968. Proving to be one of the greatest fighters in martial arts, I defended this title five more times. I decided to retire after his 1974 victory.
